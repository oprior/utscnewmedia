# Welcome to UTSC VPSC70 Theory and Practice : New Media in Studio 

Here are some example projects from Assignment 1: Data and Time

## Assignment Overview

Data builds in richness and density over time. In this assignment, you will use p5.js to create a data visualization that responds to either a physical or digital input that reflects changes in data over time. The definition of time is up to the individual (such as time can be interpreted as an event that occurs, even intervals like every 15 minutes, etc.) The final output of this work can be a live reactive piece of work or a series of documented data events. Altering images, responding to sound, body movements, keystrokes, performance, augmenting video, and printing visualizations are all options, but not limited to, for you to explore your assignment

  <summary>Project Description</summary>
<br/>  
For this assignment, I learned a lot of new code usage. The theme I chose is 
tree rings because I think tree rings can directly represent "time and data". I also 
mentioned in this assignment a timeline of the last two years of Covid-19 in Canada. 
If you click on the picture, what happens in the month and year will appear. I want to 
showcase the major events that have affected people's lives in recent years through 
the media. And use the data to store forever.
  
I think this work is challenging and meaningful. Because the things people 
experience in life are basically in the past tense and will not be deliberately reserved. 
Of course, I hope you can use the tree rings to record things at each stage. At the 
same time, you can grow slowly like a tree, and feel the process of growth.

  <summary>Project Description</summary>
<br/>  
 This artwork is collecting minutes, and more than 100 lines will be outputted every minute to create unique pictures. A reason why I create a time-related artwork is that I sometimes forget how important time is. Time is finite, and we consume the same amount of time during our lives. However, we do not care if a minute has passed because a minute is very short, and it will pass before we realize it. 
  
  Also, in creating this artwork, I faced three challenges. The first challenge was that outputting random lines with the random RGB colours resulted in less beautiful pictures. Therefore, to make unique pictures beautiful every minute, I wrote a code which finally tries to select similar numbers with the RGB color which sets every minute. The second challenge was how to express different ways of spending time while sharing 'the same amount of time." Then, I came up with using a QR code to share the code to create their own unique picture per minute. There is no physical input because no one cannot control time. The third challenge was how to update each minute on the canvas. Unfortunately, I did not know how to erase the outputted subject from the canvas, so I created a code in which lines are densely overlaid to realize time updates.

### Linjun He  | [Untitled](/utscnewmedia/StudentWorkAssignment1/linjunHe/)

<details>
  <summary>Project Description</summary>
  <br/>
 The theme of my work is that there are some things you can't do no matter how hard you try. My inspiration 
came  from  our  workshop1.  We  learned  how  to  fill  the  entire  canavas  with  random  shapes.  I  thought 
backwards  and  tried  to  use  random  graphics  to  clear  the  pattern  on  the  canavas.  This  is  very  interesting. 

  What's more interesting is that because I didn't find the right parameters, I can't clear the computer-generated 
patterns on the canavas when I randomly generate patterns. This got me thinking. In theory, as long as I press 
the mouse fast enough to clear the canavas. But it can't be done, just like some things in life, no matter how 
many times you try, you just can't get it done. At the same time, I also randomly generate the number of 
mouse clicks, so I can see how many times the mouse is clicked at any time.

### Tyler Kim  | [Dopamine and Serotonin](/utscnewmedia/StudentWorkAssignment1/tylerKim)
<details>
  <summary>Project Description</summary>
  <br/>
 In my work “Dopamine and Serotonin”, the program is presented as a simple start button
followed by a timer, counter for clicks and a button that says click. Upon clicking, a random word
from a list of words is printed onto the screen in a random size and location. Upon further
inspection, the button that says click doesn’t actually have any impact on the program and one
can click anywhere on the screen to make words pop up.
  
The idea behind this work comes from interactions on our phones on social media in an attempt
to produce dopamine and serotonin through various interactions on them. The work attempts to
simplify the interactions we go through on our phones to the core of the interaction by removing
all visual and audio queues with positive words and removing all interaction besides clicking.
The click button having no actual impact is a part of the work that aims to reflect on how many
of our interactions on social media have very little impact or meaning and could simply be
replaced by something else, in this case clicking anywhere else on the screen.
This is an important topic to me as many of my peers and/or friends are caught up in social
media and simply unable to put their phones down and are constantly consuming any bit they
can to get more “dopamine and serotonin”.

### Jennifer Kuang | [Today's Mood Chart](/utscnewmedia/StudentWorkAssignment1/jenniferKuang)
<details>
  <summary>Project Description</summary>
  <br/>
 Today’s Mood Chart is an interactive p5.js program that visualizes audio and 
simultaneously generates a chart based on the sound. The program invites audience to 
reply and response to the question “How is your day today?” in front of the 
microphone. Once the participant speaks, the ellipses on the canvas of the program 
will simultaneously duplicate and the size and color will also change, which is based 
on the frequency and volume of the sound. At the end, the participant can save the 
canvas as an image file, this is their mood chart for today.
  
This work uses data generated from the audio. Time plays a crucial role in this project 
because the chart looks different in every second as the data of the audio builds in 
richness and the ellipses change based on the data over time. The idea of this project 
is inspired by emotions/feelings chart which is a colorful wheel used by parents to 
know their children’s feeling. 

Through visualizing the audience’s audio, this project encourages audience to think 
and confess today’s mood and feeling. In this fast-paced age, things are happening 
and changing very quickly. We are overwhelmed by busy schedule and complex 
relationships, but seldom sit down and ask ourselves, “Am I happy today?” The artist 
hopes that this work can make the audience become aware of their own everyday 
moods and emotional changes.

### Liuyi Li  | [Untitled](/utscnewmedia/StudentWorkAssignment1/liuyiLi/)

<details>
  <summary>Project Description</summary>
  <br/>
 For this assignment, I made 6 clocks in a frame that ticking every 
second with ticking sound. I believe this is a very direct way showing 
how time flows on my work. For the first four clocks on the left frame, 
the  shape  and  the  colors  are  designed  by  the  inspirations  of  each 
country’s flag. Also, the first four clock’s time was exactly based 
on the real region’s time. (The first one is China, the second one is 
Ukraine, the third one is Korea and the fourth one is Canada.) 
  
For rest 2 clocks that do not have any color except black is the local 
time. As the assignment instruction illustrated to thinking about how 
the work could be presented in a gallery, personally I would want these 
2 clocks without color to showing the local time where the gallery 
located. I was trying my best distinct the colorless clocks and the 
regional clocks, so I wanted to be as creative as I can. The first 
idea came into my mind was “clock does not need to be a circle”. As 
a result, one clock is totally consisted by numbers and on the middle 
above. The biggest clock that on the right was an ellipse that consisted 
by numbers and mathematical symbols. I believe the interesting part is 
that instead of showing the exact number on the clock the equations 
could have more fun for visitors to calculate. 
  
In  general,  this  frame  was  only  consisted  by  geometric  figures  and 
characters.  My  intention  was  to  make  aesthetic  out  of  the  simplest 
things.

### Kun Peng Tang | [Untitled](/utscnewmedia/StudentWorkAssignment1/KunPengTang)
<details>
  <summary>Project Description</summary>
  <br/>
The dates shown in this project all are important dates that happened in the past two years 
against the coronavirus. Sixteen dates appeared in my project, and these sixteen different dates 
all recorded a critical event that happened on that day. In the project, I also added a clock, and I 
want to remind people that time is passing, but never forget the moments that damaged our life. 
During the coronavirus outbreak, sixteen events happened on sixteen different dates that have 
caused different levels of damage to my life and people's lives. Through this project, I want to 
record these dates forever so that the residents of this city and I can firmly remember the 
moments that the coronavirus did to our lives in the past two years.
The sixteen critical events that occurred on these sixteen dates are:
1. On January 23. 2020, the first identified case of Covid-19 in Toronto, means our life will 
change.
2. In March 17.2020, Ontario declared its first emergency during the pandemic outbreak.
3. From March 23.2020 to June 24.2020, the city was locked down for the first time, and the 
government limited the operation of important businesses.
4. On July 7.2020, Toronto introduced mask requirements for all public indoors. From that day, 
the mask became an essential item in our life.
5. On July 31.2020, the city of Toronto went into stage 3 open, which is the gym and all other 
public places are allowed to reopen, and we finally can get in touch with people and socialize with 
others.
6. On August 10.2020, it was the first summer after the coronavirus outbreak, and the city saw a 
significant decline in new cases.
7. From September 1.2020 to October 1.2020, affected cases began to rise steadily, Toronto, the 
peel region, the York Region, and Ottawa went back into stage 2 again because of the rising viral 
spread, and all the cinemas, gyms, bars, etc. closed again.
8. In July 23.2020, the city of Toronto was placed under lockdown again, and our life returned to 
isolation again.
9. On December 15.2020, with the overall plans for Covid-19 vaccinations across Canada, people 
have more hopes against the virus.
10. On December 26.2020, the government declared a province-wide shutdown. All the people in 
Ontario had to stay at home and cut off social contact with others.
11. On January 1.2021, the province declared stay-at-home orders for the entire province. It was 
the craziest order I have ever heard because the government did not recommend people go out for 
any unessential activity, such as driving around.
12. On March 8.2021, Toronto temporarily cancelled the stay-at-home orders, and people could 
finally go out.
13. On April 3.2021, following an uptick in new cases in Ontario, the province was exacerbated 
by more aggressive variants of SARS-CoV-2, and the virus became more infectious and 
dangerous.
14. On June 2.2021, the province finally started to reopen, and stages reopened the city of 
Toronto.
15. On March 21.2022, most provincial masking regulations were lifted by the government, so 
people could finally choose to wear masks or not according to their wishes.
16. On May 9.2022, the mayor John announced the termination of Toronto's Covid-19 state of 
emergency after being in effect for 777days.

  <summary>Project Description</summary>
  <br/>
In  this  project,  I  decided  to  to  a  project  about  time.  The  theme  of  this  project  is  peaceful, 
slow flow of life can let me feel relax and peaceful. When I need to relax, I always choose to sit 
on my balcony to view the scene. So, in this project I shoot the daylight view on my balcony and 
the  night  view  on  it.  I  also  recorded  the  sound  on  the  balcony  to  let  the  audience  feeling  more 
about the atmosphere. I used p5 to write a code to show the day view and night view, when the 
mouse touch the picture, it will changed into different views. When I show this project in class, i 
want my classmates feel peaceful and relax.

### Myuri Srikugan | [More Progression](/utscnewmedia/StudentWorkAssignment1/myuriSrikugan)
<details>
  <summary>Project Description</summary>
 Using three prompts, I tempt viewers to engage with my work and explore some stigmas placed on different groups within our society. There are three numbered buttons
present, each in accordance to a prompt, and when each is pressed; different points on
the map of Canada will pop up respectfully with stories of individuals that have faced
some form of struggle that is often dismissed by institutions, the government and our
community. These issues have been present for a long time, yet progression seems to
be very slow, with some changes causing us to back track instead of progress. We live
in a world where transphobia is normalized, women are silenced, and men struggle to
open up about their mental health.  
  
 I try to bring awareness to these issues by sharing the views of those that have suffered from certain stigmas and stereotypes. The colour
of the points for each prompt remains the same to show the interconnectedness of
struggle between groups that face stigmas. The quotations that appear when hovering
over points share supportive messages or cries for help from individuals around that
region of Canada. 
  
  The quotations can be very heavy and for that reason I try to create a
welcoming visually minimalistic yet appealing digital format of delivering these stories
and messages to the viewer in a digestible and approachable way. For progression to
occur, awareness must be brought to issues that are often ignored. Through More
Progression, I hope to bring awareness to a few taunting issues present in Canada
today.

### Roy Sun | [See-Wave](/utscnewmedia/StudentWorkAssignment1/roySun)
<details>
  <summary>Project Description</summary>
  <br/>
For this project I initially wanted to use videos from the same timeline to illustrate data and 
time for simplicity purposes, but unfortunately the result was not as prominent as it could be. 
My intention of this project is to bring out the contrast with different timelines. I then created a 
questionnaire where the audience can choose and select from different timelines to play, which 
can also demonstrate the use of time within the integrity of this project. 
  
The theme for this project I have chosen is Covid. I’ve been away from families and friends from 
China since 2016 for coming abroad to study, and since covid started almost three years ago I 
have not been visiting home. The entire project was revolving around the idea of series of data 
during covid period. Three different timelines were introduced, three days, three months, and 
three years. The three days category captured a plant of mine, Monstera, a recent hobby I’ve 
picked up where I’ve never thought I would. Three months was documenting my body 
transformation which also happened during Covid, where I unsurprisingly followed through also 
due to Covid. As for the three years, I’ve decided to showcase my beloved fury family members, 
my two Shiba Inus, they’ve accompanied me through Covid where I’ve struggled the most with 
stress and anxiety.
  
I believe this simple questionnaire is able to justify the relationship of data and time. Data was 
demonstrated through my videos and photographs, and because time is leaner my datas were 
also able to showcase a timeline accordingly in its timely order.

### Zhe Wang | [See-Wave](/utscnewmedia/StudentWorkAssignment1/zheWang)
<details>
  <summary>Project Description</summary>
  <br/>
The name of my project is called See-Wave. See-Wave was built with P5.js. It takes sound from microphone as an input and uses FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation) to filter the sound input. We always use computers to extract, transform, load, as well as analyze data. We tend to forget that mouse and keyboard are not the only intermediates that connect us to the computer’s brain. They way microphone takes in our sound is very similar to how we have conversations with people, instead, we are talking to the computer. 
  
  
 The code reacts to the sound around the microphone, and simultaneously filter and plot the sound wave on to the screen. The pitch of the sound, and the volume of the sound both take effect on the shape of the sound wave. However, talking to the microphone is not the only way to connect with computers via sound; We can also touch the microphone. By looking at the sound wave while touching the microphone, we get a sense of how ‘pleased’ the computer is. The faster we rub the microphone, the more disperse the wave is ---- faster motion creates louder, or in other word, noisier sound. The code dose not store any sound data from the microphone, everything presented corresponds to real-time data. It reminds us how living for the moment is important. People nowadays spend too much time looking at historical data, which creates a sense of living in the past. I’d like to have people to capture the pleasure they experience at this very moment by interacting with See-Wave.
