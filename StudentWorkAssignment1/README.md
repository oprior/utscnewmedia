# Welcome to UTSC VPSC70 Theory and Practice : New Media in Studio 

Here are some example projects from Assignment 1: Data and Time

## Assignment Overview

Data builds in richness and density over time. In this assignment, you will use p5.js to create a data visualization that responds to either a physical or digital input that reflects changes in data over time. The definition of time is up to the individual (such as time can be interpreted as an event that occurs, even intervals like every 15 minutes, etc.) The final output of this work can be a live reactive piece of work or a series of documented data events. Altering images, responding to sound, body movements, keystrokes, performance, augmenting video, and printing visualizations are all options, but not limited to, for you to explore your assignment

  <summary>Project Description</summary>
<br/>  
 This artwork is collecting minutes, and more than 100 lines will be outputted every minute to create unique pictures. A reason why I create a time-related artwork is that I sometimes forget how important time is. Time is finite, and we consume the same amount of time during our lives. However, we do not care if a minute has passed because a minute is very short, and it will pass before we realize it. 
  
  Also, in creating this artwork, I faced three challenges. The first challenge was that outputting random lines with the random RGB colours resulted in less beautiful pictures. Therefore, to make unique pictures beautiful every minute, I wrote a code which finally tries to select similar numbers with the RGB color which sets every minute. The second challenge was how to express different ways of spending time while sharing 'the same amount of time." Then, I came up with using a QR code to share the code to create their own unique picture per minute. There is no physical input because no one cannot control time. The third challenge was how to update each minute on the canvas. Unfortunately, I did not know how to erase the outputted subject from the canvas, so I created a code in which lines are densely overlaid to realize time updates.

### Linjun He  | [Untitled](/utscnewmedia/StudentWorkAssignment1/linjunHe/)

  <summary>Project Description</summary>
  <br/>
 The theme of my work is that there are some things you can't do no matter how hard you try. My inspiration 
came  from  our  workshop1.  We  learned  how  to  fill  the  entire  canavas  with  random  shapes.  I  thought 
backwards  and  tried  to  use  random  graphics  to  clear  the  pattern  on  the  canavas.  This  is  very  interesting. 

  What's more interesting is that because I didn't find the right parameters, I can't clear the computer-generated 
patterns on the canavas when I randomly generate patterns. This got me thinking. In theory, as long as I press 
the mouse fast enough to clear the canavas. But it can't be done, just like some things in life, no matter how 
many times you try, you just can't get it done. At the same time, I also randomly generate the number of 
mouse clicks, so I can see how many times the mouse is clicked at any time.

<br/>### Tyler Kim  | [Dopamine and Serotonin](/utscnewmedia/StudentWorkAssignment1/tylerKim)
<details>
  <summary>Project Description</summary>
  <br/>
 In my work “Dopamine and Serotonin”, the program is presented as a simple start button
followed by a timer, counter for clicks and a button that says click. Upon clicking, a random word
from a list of words is printed onto the screen in a random size and location. Upon further
inspection, the button that says click doesn’t actually have any impact on the program and one
can click anywhere on the screen to make words pop up.
  
The idea behind this work comes from interactions on our phones on social media in an attempt
to produce dopamine and serotonin through various interactions on them. The work attempts to
simplify the interactions we go through on our phones to the core of the interaction by removing
all visual and audio queues with positive words and removing all interaction besides clicking.
The click button having no actual impact is a part of the work that aims to reflect on how many
of our interactions on social media have very little impact or meaning and could simply be
replaced by something else, in this case clicking anywhere else on the screen.
This is an important topic to me as many of my peers and/or friends are caught up in social
media and simply unable to put their phones down and are constantly consuming any bit they
can to get more “dopamine and serotonin”.

### Jennifer Kuang | [Today's Mood Chart](/utscnewmedia/StudentWorkAssignment1/jenniferKuang)
<details>
  <summary>Project Description</summary>
  <br/>
 Today’s Mood Chart is an interactive p5.js program that visualizes audio and 
simultaneously generates a chart based on the sound. The program invites audience to 
reply and response to the question “How is your day today?” in front of the 
microphone. Once the participant speaks, the ellipses on the canvas of the program 
will simultaneously duplicate and the size and color will also change, which is based 
on the frequency and volume of the sound. At the end, the participant can save the 
canvas as an image file, this is their mood chart for today.
  
This work uses data generated from the audio. Time plays a crucial role in this project 
because the chart looks different in every second as the data of the audio builds in 
richness and the ellipses change based on the data over time. The idea of this project 
is inspired by emotions/feelings chart which is a colorful wheel used by parents to 
know their children’s feeling. 

Through visualizing the audience’s audio, this project encourages audience to think 
and confess today’s mood and feeling. In this fast-paced age, things are happening 
and changing very quickly. We are overwhelmed by busy schedule and complex 
relationships, but seldom sit down and ask ourselves, “Am I happy today?” The artist 
hopes that this work can make the audience become aware of their own everyday 
moods and emotional changes,

### Myuri Srikugan | [More Progression](/utscnewmedia/StudentWorkAssignment1/myuriSrikugan)
<details>
  <summary>Project Description</summary>
 Using three prompts, I tempt viewers to engage with my work and explore some stigmas placed on different groups within our society. There are three numbered buttons
present, each in accordance to a prompt, and when each is pressed; different points on
the map of Canada will pop up respectfully with stories of individuals that have faced
some form of struggle that is often dismissed by institutions, the government and our
community. These issues have been present for a long time, yet progression seems to
be very slow, with some changes causing us to back track instead of progress. We live
in a world where transphobia is normalized, women are silenced, and men struggle to
open up about their mental health.  
  
 I try to bring awareness to these issues by sharing the views of those that have suffered from certain stigmas and stereotypes. The colour
of the points for each prompt remains the same to show the interconnectedness of
struggle between groups that face stigmas. The quotations that appear when hovering
over points share supportive messages or cries for help from individuals around that
region of Canada. 
  
  The quotations can be very heavy and for that reason I try to create a
welcoming visually minimalistic yet appealing digital format of delivering these stories
and messages to the viewer in a digestible and approachable way. For progression to
occur, awareness must be brought to issues that are often ignored. Through More
Progression, I hope to bring awareness to a few taunting issues present in Canada
today.

### Zhe Wang | [See-Wave](/utscnewmedia/StudentWorkAssignment1/zheWang)
<details>
  <summary>Project Description</summary>
  <br/>
The name of my project is called See-Wave. See-Wave was built with P5.js. It takes sound from microphone as an input and uses FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation) to filter the sound input. We always use computers to extract, transform, load, as well as analyze data. We tend to forget that mouse and keyboard are not the only intermediates that connect us to the computer’s brain. They way microphone takes in our sound is very similar to how we have conversations with people, instead, we are talking to the computer. 
  
  
 The code reacts to the sound around the microphone, and simultaneously filter and plot the sound wave on to the screen. The pitch of the sound, and the volume of the sound both take effect on the shape of the sound wave. However, talking to the microphone is not the only way to connect with computers via sound; We can also touch the microphone. By looking at the sound wave while touching the microphone, we get a sense of how ‘pleased’ the computer is. The faster we rub the microphone, the more disperse the wave is ---- faster motion creates louder, or in other word, noisier sound. The code dose not store any sound data from the microphone, everything presented corresponds to real-time data. It reminds us how living for the moment is important. People nowadays spend too much time looking at historical data, which creates a sense of living in the past. I’d like to have people to capture the pleasure they experience at this very moment by interacting with See-Wave.
