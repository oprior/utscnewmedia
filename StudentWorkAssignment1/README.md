# Welcome to UTSC VPSC70 Theory and Practice : New Media in Studio 

Here are some example projects from Assignment 1: Data and Time

###Assignment Overview
Data builds in richness and density over time. In this assignment, you will use p5.js to create a data visualization that responds to either a physical or digital input that reflects changes in data over time. The definition of time is up to the individual (such as time can be interpreted as an event that occurs, even intervals like every 15 minutes, etc.) The final output of this work can be a live reactive piece of work or a series of documented data events. Altering images, responding to sound, body movements, keystrokes, performance, augmenting video, and printing visualizations are all options, but not limited to, for you to explore your assignment

#### Project Description:
>This artwork is collecting minutes, and more than 100 lines will be outputted every minute to create unique pictures. A reason why I create a time-related artwork is that I sometimes forget how important time is. Time is finite, and we consume the same amount of time during our lives. However, we do not care if a minute has passed because a minute is very short, and it will pass before we realize it. Also, in creating this artwork, I faced three challenges. The first challenge was that outputting random lines with the random RGB colours resulted in less beautiful pictures. Therefore, to make unique pictures beautiful every minute, I wrote a code which finally tries to select similar numbers with the RGB color which sets every minute. The second challenge was how to express different ways of spending time while sharing 'the same amount of time." Then, I came up with using a QR code to share the code to create their own unique picture per minute. There is no physical input because no one cannot control time. The third challenge was how to update each minute on the canvas. Unfortunately, I did not know how to erase the outputted subject from the canvas, so I created a code in which lines are densely overlaid to realize time updates.

#### Project Description:
> The theme of my work is that there are some things you can't do no matter how hard you try. My inspiration 
came  from  our  workshop1.  We  learned  how  to  fill  the  entire  canavas  with  random  shapes.  I  thought 
backwards  and  tried  to  use  random  graphics  to  clear  the  pattern  on  the  canavas.  This  is  very  interesting. 
What's more interesting is that because I didn't find the right parameters, I can't clear the computer-generated 
patterns on the canavas when I randomly generate patterns. This got me thinking. In theory, as long as I press 
the mouse fast enough to clear the canavas. But it can't be done, just like some things in life, no matter how 
many times you try, you just can't get it done. At the same time, I also randomly generate the number of 
mouse clicks, so I can see how many times the mouse is clicked at any time.
